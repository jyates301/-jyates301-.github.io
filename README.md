# Jordan Yates – Intro to AI (AI 109) Course Site

- **Deployed website URL**: `https://jyates301.io`
- **Purpose**: A single-page, static portfolio-style site presenting my work and information for the Intro to AI (AI 109) course.

## AI Usage

I used an AI coding assistant (OpenAI GPT-5.1 in Cursor) to help draft the initial versions of the SDLC documents (README, DESIGN, TESTING) and the HTML/CSS for the website. The AI assisted in organizing the content, suggesting semantic HTML5 structure, and proposing a clean, responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries. I then reviewed and edited the generated content so it accurately describes my actual page structure, design choices, and testing steps for this project.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Check that the deploys link loads**  
  Open the deployed site URL in a desktop browser and confirm that the page loads without errors.

- [ ] **Check for broken links**  
  Click each navigation item (Home, About, Projects) and the GitHub profile link to ensure they all go to the correct sections or pages without 404 errors.

- [ ] **Check that it works on a phone**  
  Open the deployed site on a physical phone (or a mobile device) and confirm that all content is readable, navigation is usable, and layout stacks correctly.

- [ ] **Verify responsive layout on different screen sizes**  
  Resize the browser window (or use dev tools responsive mode) to test small, medium, and large widths and confirm that the header, sections, and project card remain well-aligned.

- [ ] **Confirm smooth scrolling behavior**  
  Click the navigation links and ensure the page scrolls smoothly to the corresponding sections instead of jumping abruptly.

- [ ] **Validate basic accessibility and readability**  
  Check that text contrast is sufficient, headings are clear, content can be navigated with the keyboard (Tab key), and fonts are large enough to read comfortably.
